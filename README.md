# Purpose
As a final project for computer networks, the goal was to build an application that mirrored the abilities of sites such as [Firefox Send](https://send.firefox.com/) and [MegaNZ](https://mega.nz/). To build an app that enabled secure sharing of files by way of confidentiality, files are encrypted client side using AES-GCM 256 through Webcrypto api. This is accomplished in a separate thread using a JavaScript webworker so as to not tie up the front end UI. The file is encrypted using a random generated IV of 12 bytes so as to ensure the same file encrypted twice will never produce the same cipher block. The files original name and file mime type are also encrypted. These three chunks are then uploaded to the server where the file is then passed for storage into Google's Cloud Storage and the other two are stored in the sites database. The client then receives back from the server a unique uuid for the file that is then used in generating a decryption link in the form of 

[file uuid][Base64'd IV][AES-256 key]

On client request for decryption the opposite transaction occurs, sending the server only the file uuid, the server returns the original encrypted file name and mime from the database and then generates a limited time link for download access to the encrypted file. The client using this information and the other two pieces of the link then decrypts and reassembles the original file before offering up to save it.

This project made use of Webcrypto Api, HTML 5, Javascript Webworkers, Angular 4-5, NodeJS and Postgresql.

It should be noted that there is only **confidentiality** here in that the server will never know the original secret because the key is never passed to the server. The security in this method is only as good as how the link is shared since there is no prekey sharing and the recipient is not known ahead of time such that asymmetric keys can be used.

It should also be noted that encryption is not my background and thus errors may have been introduced into the system by my part. Assuming the programmer [I] didnâ€™t bungle something, you still have to put trust into JavaScript based encryption and the rest of the chain.

# Drop File Encrypted share

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Third Party Requirements
1.Heroku

2.Heroku Managed Postgresql

3.Google Cloud Services

***
## Pre-Setup
Assuming the above requirements, this project makes use of these services, no guarantee is made for other setups.
You will need a heroku account. A google cloud services account. Already installed NodeJS > 9.6, Angular CLI, Yarn package manager.
This project used yarn, but it might work with npm no guarantee.

## Setup
Clone Project,

  Run npm install / yarn install to get dependencies

## Setup - Heroku
Run the following command in your shell of choice in the cloned project directory to create and attach an empty heroku project.


```heroku create```

## Setup - Heroku Database
Using heroku.com's dashboard select your project and under resources tab  -> add-ons search for herokus postgresql database.
Once that has been added you can test remote connections following [Heroku Remote DB connections](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/connecting-to-heroku-postgres-databases-from-outside-of-heroku) through PGadmin for checking tables.
After confirming that the addon is working run in your shell of choice, making sure you launch this command from the same directory location for createTables.sql which should be in the folder sql.


```heroku pg:psql --app [YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE] < createTables.sql```

 ## Setup - Google Cloud Service
 You will need a [Google cloud service account](https://cloud.google.com/)
  Google provides a free 1 year no charge account to their services and 300$ credit. There is no catch and no billing when the trial ends just that it will no longer work unless you pay to upgrade.
  
  Once you have a google cloud account you will need to create a project and a bucket, make note of the project-id as you will need this later. Name the bucket how ever you like. Once those steps are done you will need to create an IAM service account so that heroku will be able to access this bucket this can be found under the IAM & Admin. The service account should be created for server to server, with read/write/delete access to the bucket you created. Once done you need to export the key it generates, save this somewhere safe.
  
At this point you will need to download and install googles gsutil command line tools, you will need to set up cors on your bucket so that users using the app with the server generating time limited links will be able to download their encrypted files.


```gsutil cors set cors-config.json gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME```


See [here](https://developer.bitmovin.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000059353-How-do-I-set-up-CORS-for-my-Google-Cloud-Storage-Bucket-) for an example cors file.

Not included in this git is the cors-config file used.
 
***

### Note this project makes use of .env to hide keys for local development
Because of this, these keys will not work unless they are entered as config vars on heroku.

This app uses the following Key / Pairs for local development you should create a .env file in the root of the project folder making sure to add this to git ignore. 

#### DO NOT EVER COMMIT KEYS.

DATABASE_URL can be found under herokus dashboard for the add-on database, by clicking on it and going to datastores -> settings -> view credentials copy the connection string and paste it into your .env file.


```
DATABASE_URL = [The url connection string to the heroku database]
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS = [The Entire key generated earlier when exporting the service account]
GOOGLE_BUCKET = [In single quotes ' Name of the project id ']
GOOGLE_BUCKET_NAME = [ In single quotes ' Name of the bucket ' ]
```


The follow config vars in .env also need to be copied into herokus config vars for your project.
Heroku wraps vars with single quotes, so do not add them to GOOGLE_BUCKET and GOOGLE_BUCKET_NAME for heroku.

## Push and Deployment to heroku
Assuming everything is setup correctly and the master for the project is up to date.


```git push heroku master```


Will start the build process.

***
## ((Optionally)) Running Local


```yarn postinstall``` Will build and compile the app.


```yarn start``` will run the local app, this still assumes you setup correctly the .env file.
